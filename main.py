# Idea: 
# I built a pipeline to scrape and structure 2,000 IGN reviews, 
# enriched the data using an API, 
# and trained a model to understand scoring trends. 
# It turns out IGN favors RPGs and penalizes racing games.
# Can't use API because it only serves 10 reviews and limits to 100 requests

# Questions:
# - which genres/platforms get higher scores?
# - which writers give higher scores?
# - did IGN's average scores change over time?
# - are DLCs and expansions higher rated than standalone games?
# - are sequels in general well reviewed?
# - in terms of name, genre, platform - can an LLM predict and generate the "perfect IGN game"?

# ------ 1. Cache the data ------

    if os.path.exists(CACHE_PATH):
        with open(CACHE_PATH, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
